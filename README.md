# Polynomial Calculator

This project is a Java application that implements a polynomial calculator with a simple and intuitive user interface. The user can enter two polynomials and perform various mathematical operations on them, such as:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division (with checks for special cases)
* Differentiation
* Integration

The result of the operations is displayed instantly in the interface.

## Main Features

* **Mathematical input format:** Enter polynomials easily (e.g., `2x^3 + 4x - 5`).
* **Dedicated buttons:** Separate buttons for each mathematical operation.
* **Intuitive interface:** Simple and easy to use.
* **Automatic checks:** Handles special cases like division by zero.
* **Modular implementation:** Built using efficient data structures.
* **Unit tests:** Includes tests to validate the main functions.

## Project Structure

**src/**
* `Polinom.java` – Class for representing a polynomial.
* `Operatii.java` – Implementation of the mathematical operations.
* `Controler.java` – Manages the application logic.
* `Vedere.java` – The graphical user interface (GUI).
* `Main.java` – The entry point of the application.

**test/**
* Unit tests to verify functionality.

## Future Improvements

* A more attractive user interface.
* More robust validation of user input.
* Support for more complex polynomial operations.
